## Course Description

<p>Explore the application of functional programming principles in modern C++ using features introduced in C++17, C++20, and C++23. In this course, instructor Troy MIles shows you how to write more modular, expressive, and efficient code by leveraging features such as lambdas, ranges, coroutines, and concepts. Along the way, discover how functional pipelines, metaprogramming, and the constexpr specifier can transform your approach to problem-solving in C++. This course also covers functional reactive programming, pattern matching, and the integration of functional and imperative styles to help you master advanced C++ techniques.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.
